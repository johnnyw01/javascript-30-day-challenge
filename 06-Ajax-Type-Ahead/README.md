# Population Search Application
This program is a population search application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It reads a JSON file containing cities and states data with their corresponding population information. The application provides two search functionalities: filtering based on a keyword and displaying matching results dynamically as the user types.

* Real-time Results Update: The search results are updated dynamically as the user types.
* Highlighting Matched Text: The matched words in the search results are visually highlighted.
* Population Formatting: The population numbers in the search results are formatted with commas for readability.

## Data Source
The program fetches the cities and states data from a JSON file hosted on GitHub. The file contains population information from 2013. The data retrieval is performed using the Fetch API.
